# C964_Flask_app

This was the capstone project for my B.S. in Computer Science. I was required to apply machine learning techniques to a dataset.
I chose to create a video game recommendation application using a free dataset from Kaggle.com. The ML technique used for the project
was a K-nearest neighbors algorithm. 

This was a great learning experience from start to finish. I had never used any sort of ML prior to this project, and it gave me the
opportunity to learn a bit about using Flask and how to host an application on Heroku. 

The quality of the recommendations themselves are a little lacking but were acceptable for the project criteria. Were I to try this again
I would use a better dataset and perhaps research a different ML technique to use. I would also include error handling and input validation.

The project is hosted at: https://flask-game-recommender.herokuapp.com
